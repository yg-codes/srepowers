description: Generate an interactive bash wizard that walks a human through steps only they can perform. Use for console-only procedures — vendor portal config, certificate rotation on a CA dashboard, CI/secret provisioning, third-party SaaS setup, a one-off migration, or a change-cutover that needs human approvals. Don't invoke this for steps the agent can perform itself.

# Wizard

A **wizard** is a bash script that walks a human, step by step, through a manual procedure that's tedious to do by hand and tedious to re-explain to an AI every time. It opens each URL, says exactly what to click and copy, captures the values, writes them where they belong (`.env`, GitHub/GitLab secrets), confirms at every stage, and shows how much is left. It might configure a third-party service, walk a vendor support portal, run a one-off migration, or drive a change cutover through an approval console.

The delightful UX is already solved by [template.sh](template.sh) — progress with time-remaining, confirmation gates, cross-platform URL opening (including WSL), hidden secret entry, idempotent `.env` upserts, `gh secret`/`gh variable` writes, and a closing summary. **Your job is only to scope the procedure and author its stages.** The library above the `STAGES` marker is identical in every wizard; that consistency is the point — never hand-edit it.

A wizard is ephemeral by default — built for one run, saved to a scratch or `scripts/` path, deleted when the job's done. Commit it only when the user wants a repeatable setup path that should live in the repo (e.g. onboarding a new cluster, a recurring vendor renewal).

## Process

### 1. Scope the procedure

Work out every manual step the human must take and every value that gets captured along the way. Read the repo and runbooks first — don't ask cold:

- For setup/secret provisioning: `.env`, `.env.example`, `.env.*`, `README`, `docker-compose*`, Helm `values.yaml`, and CI config (`.github/workflows/*`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`) — every `secrets.*` / `vars.*` / `$CI_*` reference is a value the wizard must produce.
- For a migration, cutover, or rotation: the current state, the target state, and the irreversible actions between them (and the rollback path — see `srepowers-core:change-management`).

Then show the user the ordered list of stages and the values each produces, and confirm — they may add, drop, or reorder.

**Done when:** every stage is named in order, and for each captured value you know (a) where the human gets it, (b) where it's written (`.env`, a CI secret, both, or nowhere — some stages are pure actions), and (c) whether it's secret (hidden entry) or public.

### 2. Map each stage's journey

For each stage, write the precise path a human follows: which URL to open, what to do there, where a value is shown, which variable it fills — e.g. "CA console → Certificates → Request → paste CSR → download chain → copy". Where you don't actually know the current UI or the exact command, say so and ask the user or check the docs — never invent steps that may not exist.

**Done when:** every stage traces to concrete instructions a stranger could follow.

### 3. Author the wizard

Copy `template.sh` to the target path. Replace the example stage with one `stage` per step, in dependency order. Use the library helpers — `stage`, `say`/`step`, `open_url`, `ask`/`ask_secret`, `write_env`, `set_secret`/`set_var`, `pause`/`confirm` — and set `TOTAL_STAGES` and `TOTAL_MINUTES` to honest estimates (this drives the time-remaining display).

Hold the bar the template sets: open the URL before asking for its value, use `ask_secret` for anything secret, `write_env` every persisted value, `set_secret` only the values CI actually needs, and `confirm` before any irreversible action. Each `stage` clears the screen so only the current step is visible — keep a stage to one focused task so nothing the human needs scrolls away. Don't touch the library above the marker.

### 4. Verify and hand off

- `bash -n <script>`; run `shellcheck` if available.
- `chmod +x <script>`.
- Don't run it end-to-end yourself — it opens browsers and blocks on human input. Trace it statically instead: every value from step 1 is captured and lands where step 1 said, and every `set_secret` name exactly matches a secret reference in CI.
- Tell the user how to run it. If it's a repeatable setup path, commit it and link it from the README/runbook so the next person runs the script instead of asking an AI.
